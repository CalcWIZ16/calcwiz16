### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on random java plugins for Minecraft
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my Minecraft server
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Discord: calcwiz

I do Java, and python, and random projects that come into my head. I also have experience with personal server hosting and networking and all that cause I have a lame Minecraft Server. Also apparently I do freelance web dev (with no guarantees) which is cool..?
