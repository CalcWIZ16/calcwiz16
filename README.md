### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on random java plugins for Minecraft
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Minecraft server
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord: calcwiz

I do Java, python, and random projects that come into my head. I also have experience with personal server hosting and networking and all that cause I have a lame Minecraft Server. Also apparently I do freelance web dev (with no guarantees) which is cool..?

if you want something cool to look at

FAQ:
- The Minecraft server is private, please do not ask to join
- The username is an ironic inside joke; I almost failed pre-calc
- I don't use github that much cause I forget to commit
- the portfolio site will never be done
- Project Lucy has gone private
- I use Arch btw (asked no one)
